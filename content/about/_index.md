I am Yichao Xu, a postgraduate in Computer Security and Software Engineering. I am a Ph.D. student in the computer sciences department of Johns Hopkins under the supervision of [Prof. Yinzhi Cao](https://yinzhicao.org)  
I am currently working on a static analysis project (static analysis on PHP programs) and also a V2X-related project (DoS on the DSRC & CV2X). If you want to discuss those topics with me, please feel free to send me an email.  
I am happy to talk with anyone who works or studies in the computer sciences, especially computer security related, to share the new research idea.
