## 0. Introduction

I am Yichao, a postgraduate in Security Informatics and Software Engineering. I am looking forward to any Ph.D. opportunity in computer sciences, especially computer security and software engineering aspects. 

I believe that I am a competitive student who can handle the issue individually, improve self-capability gradually and face tangled circumstances robustly. If you want to know more about my personality, please browser my "[personal statement](/personal-statement)". 

If you are more interested in my background, I will demonstrate myself from the three aspects in the remaining parts: 
* Firstly, my [academic background](#1-academic-background),
* Secondly, [research project](#2-research-project) experiences, 
* Thirdly, [industrial project](#3-industrial-project) experiences, 

## 1. Academic Background

### 1.0 Take-away message

I am currently studying at JHU focusing on computer security. I obtain my first master degree in software engineering at UCL (GPA 3.9). As my bachelor degree, it is at the University of Liverpool (GPA 3.9). My major was information computer sciences and software development. All information there can prove my study capability for new techniques and topics.

### 1.1 JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY

| Duration | Major | Degree |
| - | - | - | 
| 2021 - 2022 | Security Informatics (Research and Technique) | Master of Sciences|

This fall, I started my second master's education at JHU focusing on computer security. I worked on two research projects: one is about the static analysis of JavaScript and another is about V2X communication. 

### 1.2 UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON

| Duration | Major | Degree | GPA |
| - | - | - | - |
| 2019 - 2020 | System Software Engineering | MSc with Distinction | Over 3.9 |

In UCL, I obtained my master's degree with distinction at UCL, and the major is system software engineering. The core courses include software architecture design, software validation & verification.

### 1.3 UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL

| Duration | Major | Degree | GPA |
| - | - | - | - |
| 2017 - 2019 | Software Development & Information Computer Sciences | BSc with First Honour | Over 3.9 |

In Liverpool, I obtained my first honour degree in software development and ICS. My courses were about the basic computer sciences, such as algorithm, data structure, operation system, databases, various programming languages, etc. 

## 2. Research Project

### 2.0 Take-away message

I worked in various different research projects, and most of them are about the security and software engineering. 

I currently worked in two projects simultaneously in JHU. They are about websecurity and V2X security. Both of them are still in developing processes. My previous reseachs focus on the code maintenance and the IoT system.

It means I am famious about the research processes and are able to handle research question individually. 

### 2.1 Static Analysis of JavaScript

| Duration | Institution | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2021.9-Now | Johns Hopkins University | Part-time Research Assistant | 

In this project, I worked with two doctor candidates to implement an idea, using the Object Dependency Graph to find out the possible vulnerabilities on objects. My works focus on another software, in which I tried to transfer the control flow graph generated in our system into that used in that one. The project is implemented by Scala.

### 2.2 V2X communication simulation

| Duration | Institution | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2021.9-Now | Johns Hopkins University | Part-time Research Assistant | 

In this project, I worked in a JHU professor's V2X project. We constructed multiple different circumstances for V2X communication, including the CAM and DEMN messages. We used Mininet-WiFi and Veins in our simulation. 

### 2.3 Mining repositories to establish the test-to-code links

| Duration | Place | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2020.03-2020.06 | London | Researcher | 

In the project, I mined GitHub repositories of six open-source Java projects. The results demonstrated the tests maintenance approaches of the developers.
Based on these data, I optimised the classical CoEv strategy by the cocreation and coevolution relationship between the tests and functions codes.
After that, I evaluated its precision on the other three java repositories, and the final result showed that the optimisations improve the precision by thirty per-cent.

### 2.4 Analysing the DoS attacks to IoT system

| Duration | Place | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2017.07-2017.09 | Suzhou | Researcher | 

In the project, I worked with the teammates to test an IoT system's performance under three different DoS attacks.
I used pressure test tools such as Ping3 and Hunk to launch the DoS attacks and modified the sources codes of the LOIC to customise the frequency and size of the attack packages. The results were collected by a Python program and Wireshark automatically.


## 3. Industrial Project

### 3.0 Take-away message

I have various industrial projects. In this section, I demonstrated the recent two of them. Last year, I worked on an Hyperledger Fabric framework, which is mainly about the system architecture design for a tracking system of commercial explosives. The second one is about the android packages, in which we used the TensorFlow-lite in mobile devices. 

These projects show my capability for not only project management but also programming and development. Besides, I used various programming languages in real projects including Java, C++, C#, Python, Perl, Scala, Swift, Kotlin, JavaScript, etc.

### 3.1 Blockchain-based tracing system for the commercial explosives industry

| Duration | Institution | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2020.11-2021.02 | China Academy of Industrial Internet | Research Assistant | 

In CAII, I worked with Dr. He on a project about commercial explosives. I focused on the framework design for a platform that makes the government be able to monitor the manufacture, usage, and distribution of explosives. 
In the design, I imported the Hyperledge Fabric to make all data immutable and used the private data set to protect the business's secrets. The CAII accepted my system design.

### 3.2 Android Package (Kotlin)

| Duration | Project | Role |
| - | - | - | 
| 2019.11-2020.04 | Android package to predict the health status | Android Developer | 

In that project, I used Kotlin to implement an Android framework, and I contributed about ten thousands lines of codes. The framework can upload sensitive data for training the global model and download the model for health score predicting.
I used the following techniques and frameworks: Kotlin and MVVM (Ensuring the usability of the framework), Retrofit2 and WorkerManager (Uploading data and scheduling the upload), Tensorflow-Lite (Implementing the local machine learning), SQLite (Storing the machine learning model and sensitive data), Asynchronous encryption and data noise (Avoid the data abusing and eavesdropping).
I did the code review with "CarefulAI", A software development company from the UK. They accepted all functionalities, and the framework may be used in the NHSX project in the future.
The codes of the framework can be founded from the link "https://github.com/aunroel/nhs_app/tree/android_branch/Android"
